Shiny app and parameterized RMarkdown report to calculate (protein and peptide) concentrations from BCA assays.

The app can be found in the following link: [https://prado-lab.shinyapps.io/bca-assay/](https://prado-lab.shinyapps.io/bca-assay/)

It needs:
* The Excel (.xlsx) file generated by the plate reader (without any modification or tampering)
* An annotation Excel (.xlsx) file that specifies the location (with a letter-number code, such as: A1), within the plate, of the samples
* Indicate the type of assay to perform (protein or peptide)
* Indicate the cell position(s) of both blanks (BC and BS) (with a letter-number code, as in the annotation file)
* Indicate the dilution factor (if none was performed, input 1)
